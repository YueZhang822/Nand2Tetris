# Nand2Tetris

This repository is a collection of the assignments from Course [From Nand to Teris](https://www.nand2tetris.org), an indepth exploration of computer systems. This course offered hands-on assignments aimed at building a general-purpose computer system and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up.

## Project 1: Logic Gates

Implemented a series of basic logic gates using Hardware Description Language (HDL).

## Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic

Built a set of chips that carry out arithmetic addition, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

## Project 3: Memory

Built a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit. This involves two main issues: (i) using gate logic to store bits persistently, over time, and (ii) using gate logic to locate ("address") the memory register on which we wish to operate.

## Project 4: Machine Language

Wrote some low-level machine language programs. In particular, wrote programs in the Hack assembly language, which were then translated into binary code using an assembler.

## Project 5: Computer Architecture

Integrated the previously built ALU and RAM devices into a functional computer system, enabling it to execute programs written in the Hack machine language.

## Project 6: Assembler

Developed an assembler that translates programs written in the Hack assembly language into Hack binary code. 

## Project 7: VM 1: Stack Arithmetic

Built a basic Virtual Machine (VM) translator capable of handling the arithmetic-logical operations and push/pop commands of the VM language

## Project 8: VM 2: Progam Control

Extend the previouly built basic VM translator into a full-scale VM translator, capable of handling multi-file programs written in the VM language. 

## Project 9: High Level Language

Wrote a classic snake game in Jack programming L=language (a Java-like, object-based programming language). I encourage you to check it out.

## Project 10: Compiler 1: Syntax Analysis

Completed the first stage of a compiler for Jack programming language (a Java-like, object-based programming language), by building a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar. 

## Project 11: Compiler 2: Code Generation

Extended the previouly built Syntax Analyzer into a full-scale Jack compiler, by replacing the routines that generate passive XML output with routines that generate executable VM code.

## Acknowlegements

The course [From Nand to Teris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) was meticulously crafted by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. I encourage you to check their official website by following the link if you are interested in learning about computer systems.

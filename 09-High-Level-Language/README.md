## Rules:

When the game starts, a snake with a length of 2 segments, each segment measuring 8x8 pixels, appears on the screen, along with food represented as a circle with a radius of 8 pixels. The user controls the snake's movement direction using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys on the keyboard. The goal is to maneuver the snake towards the food. Consuming the food allows the snake to grow longer. The player must avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body to continue progressing in the game.

At the beginning of the game, the user can specify the mode of play. Press 'e' to start in easy mode, where the snake moves slowly. Pressing 'h' initiates hard mode, where the snake moves very quickly. Pressing any other key will start the game in the default medium mode.

At the end of each round, the user is asked if they want to play again. Pressing 'y' will start a new round, while pressing 'n' will exit the game.
